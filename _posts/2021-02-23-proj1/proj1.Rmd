title: "California Oil Spill Incident Tracking"
description: |
  The California Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) Incident Tracking Database tracks and records oil spills throughout the state. The analysis in this report utilized the database to visualize findings with California county shapefile data. For both shapefile datasets the CRS is WGS84 (epsg: 3857) so no transformation was needed.

**Total counts for oil spill events in inland California for the year 2008** visualized as a static chloropleth map. Total counts were calculated by county and are shown with color. Higher counts are visualized as darker colors, lighter colors show lower counts.

```{r}
# Read in data from CA DFW Oil Spill Incident Tracking
osi_track <- read_sf(here("data","OSI_tracking","OSI_tracking.shp")) %>% 
  clean_names()

# Read in CA County shapefile data from the US Census Bureau
ca_counties <- read_sf(here("data","ca_counties","CA_Counties_TIGER2016.shp")) %>% 
  clean_names()

# Subset CA county shapefile data to include necessary variables
ca_subset <- ca_counties %>% 
  select(name, aland) %>% 
  rename(county_name = name, land_area = aland)

# Rename `inlandmari` variable for visualization purposes
osi_subset <- osi_track %>% 
  rename("Incident Location" = inlandmari)

```

### California Inland & Marine Oil Spill Location
```{r}
# Create tmap
tm_shape(ca_subset, name = "test") +
  tm_borders("black", lwd = .5) +
tm_shape(osi_subset) +
  tm_dots(col = "Incident Location", scale = .6)
```
**Locations of inalnd oil spill events** included in the OSPR California data. Incident location is visualized as dots (teal for inland events and yellow for marine events).
